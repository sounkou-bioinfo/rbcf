Title: vcf and bcf processing
Author: Pierre Lindenbaum <plindenbaum@yahoo.fr>
Maintainer: Sounkou Mahamae Toure <sounkoutoure@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0)
Description: C Bindings to htslib (<https://github.com/samtools/htslib>)  for reading vcf/bcf files.
     The package contains a set of functions to open/close/scan/query a vcf/bcf file, as well a
     some functions to extract data from variants and genotypes.
     The package is working although it might evolve in the future ( nature of the returned object, names of the functions, etc...).
     I also need to improve the tests and the documentation.
